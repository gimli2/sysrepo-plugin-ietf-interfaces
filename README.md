## Sysrepo plugin for interface management

This repository houses a [sysrepo](https://github.com/sysrepo/sysrepo) plugin
which implements (parts of the) [A YANG Data Model for Interface Management ](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7223).

You'll need the ``sysrepo-plugind`` in order to make this work.

### Installation

Build and install ``sysrepo`` and then use a standard CMake setup for this.
