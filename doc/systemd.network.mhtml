    </p><p>The main network file must have the extension <code class=3D"fil=
ename">.network</code>; other
    extensions are ignored. Networks are applied to links whenever the link=
s appear.</p><p>The <code class=3D"filename">.network</code> files are read=
 from the files located in the system
    network directory <code class=3D"filename">/usr/lib/systemd/network</co=
de>, the volatile runtime network
    directory <code class=3D"filename">/run/systemd/network</code> and the =
local administration network
    directory <code class=3D"filename">/etc/systemd/network</code>. All con=
figuration files are collectively
    sorted and processed in lexical order, regardless of the directories in=
 which they live.
    However, files with identical filenames replace each other. Files in <c=
ode class=3D"filename">/etc</code>
    have the highest priority, files in <code class=3D"filename">/run</code=
> take precedence over files with
    the same name in <code class=3D"filename">/usr/lib</code>. This can be =
used to override a system-supplied
    configuration file with a local file if needed. As a special case, an e=
mpty file (file size 0)
    or symlink with the same name pointing to <code class=3D"filename">/dev=
/null</code> disables the
    configuration file entirely (it is "masked").</p><p>Along with the netw=
ork file <code class=3D"filename">foo.network</code>, a "drop-in" directory
    <code class=3D"filename">foo.network.d/</code> may exist. All files wit=
h the suffix
    "<code class=3D"literal">.conf</code>" from this directory will be pars=
ed after the file itself is
    parsed. This is useful to alter or add configuration settings, without =
having to modify the main
    configuration file. Each drop-in file must have appropriate section hea=
ders.</p><p>In addition to <code class=3D"filename">/etc/systemd/network</c=
ode>, drop-in "<code class=3D"literal">.d</code>"
    directories can be placed in <code class=3D"filename">/usr/lib/systemd/=
network</code> or
    <code class=3D"filename">/run/systemd/network</code> directories. Drop-=
in files in
    <code class=3D"filename">/etc</code> take precedence over those in <cod=
e class=3D"filename">/run</code> which in turn
    take precedence over those in <code class=3D"filename">/usr/lib</code>.=
 Drop-in files under any of these
    directories take precedence over the main netdev file wherever located.=
 (Of course, since
    <code class=3D"filename">/run</code> is temporary and <code class=3D"fi=
lename">/usr/lib</code> is for vendors, it is
    unlikely drop-ins should be used in either of those places.)</p><p>Note=
 that an interface without any static IPv6 addresses configured, and neithe=
r DHCPv6
    nor IPv6LL enabled, shall be considered to have no IPv6 support. IPv6 w=
ill be automatically
    disabled for that interface by writing "1" to
    <code class=3D"filename">/proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/<em class=3D"replaceab=
